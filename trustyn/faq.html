   <span class="ques">Q. Does signing up with an existing social network have any advantages over creating an account with email?</span>
   <span class="ans">A. Yes, signing up with a social network allows you to recommend people from an existing list of friends and connections 
   and ultimately will save you lot’s of time when creating your network. It’s strongly recommended to sign-up with an existing social network 
   to get the true Trustyn experience.</span>

   <span class="ques">Q. How is Trustyn different from LinkedIn?</span>
   <span class="ans">A. LinkedIn is built off of self-promotion and the number of connections a person has. Because of this, you can never truly trust the people or the authenticity of anything on LinkedIn. Trustyn on the other hand is built off of people putting their names behind 9 brilliant people of their choice. It’s not about you, but the other person. This creates a practical network of skilled and ethical people.</span>

   <span class="ques">Q. How does the UI work?</span>
   <span class="ans">A. Trustyn uses an intuitive connection map that allows you to visualize, search, and pin point exactly the type of people 
   you might be looking for on Trustyn. A map over a conventional networking UI also allows for a much more personal and engaging experience.</span>

   <span class="ques">Q. Do you need to recommend / share 9 people?</span>
   <span class="ans">A. No, in fact you don’t have to share any. Though it’s strongly advised that you add at least 3 people to your network to 
   truly experience and get the most out of Trustyn.</span>

   <span class="ques">Q. What if I recommend / share somebody that’s not on Trustyn?</span>
   <span class="ans">A. You simply enter in some basic information about the person you’re sharing and that same person will be sent an email 
   prompting them to complete the information. After he or she does this then all the work on your part is complete and the shared person will 
   be given the option to set up an account. </span>
