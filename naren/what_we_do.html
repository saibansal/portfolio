     <h1>OUR PROGRAMS</h1>
     <p>NAREN has designed several programs that will assist underprivileged students and underserved schools. NAREN programs include:</p>
     <p>
      <span>Entrepreneurship and Innovative Education: </span>This program is designed to create and foster an entrepreneurial ecosystem by
       training prospective and existing business owners.  NAREN has partnered with the Kauffman Foundation, which is the leading 
       foundation of entrepreneurship in the world, to train current and aspiring business owners.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>Demand for Digital Education: </span>
       With books becoming obsolete and the demand for computer use is now a necessity rather than a luxury, NAREN is committed to 
       improving the use of computer in schools in order for students to have free access to information. This program is designed to 
       improve computer access and use through workshops, computer training programs, and supply of computers to selected schools. To make 
       this possible, NAREN has partnered with OLPC to supply computers to selected schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>Rebuilding Dilapidated Schools: </span>In Nigeria, not only does school lag behind in technology, most public schools need basic schools supplies in classrooms and a better learning environment. Some public schools still lack basic school amenities. NAREN is committed to help create a better learning environment by assisting in rebuilding school facilities. </p>
