              <p>As digital technology advances and finds new applications in our world, people are constantly
                initiating projects to digitize collections of books, manuscripts, photographs and newspapers. This has
                created huge repositories of information which their communities are subsequently using to effect change
                ahead of time. At this juncture, it becomes our responsibility to do the same for preserving our
                collections and making them accessible for research and education.

              </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Panjab is still in deep slumber. Our scholars are not able to reach out and achieve many
                of the desired results despite great thought. This is due, in part, to the fact that we do not have a
                credible central repository to rely on in Panjab. Currently no individual or institution is working to
                this end. For the purpose, PDL is providing both digitization and Web access services to interested
                individuals. In this huge task we seek the support and contribution of all the authors, scholars,
                thinkers and publishers.

              </p>
              <p>Under the project, we are providing online access to documents related to Sikhs and Panjab, with full
                text search capabilities. This will allow interested people from around the world to find relevant books
                more easily, and thus increase their visibility and sales. One will simply enter keywords in the search
                box and the Web site will find all pages whose content matches the search criteria. Once a book has been
                found, the individual will have the ability to: search the contents for further matches and read it
                online for free if it is in public domain. More features like buy the book from the publisher, learn
                about the author and the publisher will be added soon. Because we must respect copyright law and the
                tremendous effort authors put into their work, unless explicitly permitted, people will only see
                information about the book, plus a few sample pages if the book is not considered part of public domain.
                Researchers may prefer to buy the books, as a hard copy is sometime handier than an online version. We
                feel that this arrangement will benefit everyone, authors, publishers and readers alike. Publishers and
                authors can avail this service by sending in their book for digitization and uploading in our searchable
                format. This free service will absolve the publishers and authors from the burdensome cost and effort
                associated with digitization, including keeping employees, buying equipment, spending time, money,
                energy, etc.

              </p>
              <p>With genuine concern for Panjab's heritage, this venture is meant to save the legacy of history,
                information and culture under the agenda of a non-profit. If any funding is generated, it will be used
                to further the library project, or as specified under an agreement reached for a particular book with an
                author and/or publisher.
