        <ul>
        <li>Q. Are there an special arrangement in place to facilitate a test candidatie who has a disability or a language 
        difficulty?</li>
        <li>A. If you are deaf or cannot speak English you may have an interpreter accompany you. This person may not be your 
        driving instructor and s/he cannot accompany you on the practical element of the test. The tester may show written 
        instructions for this part of the test and display them as appropriate; the tester may also use basic sign language. You 
        should also note that if the vehicle you present for the test is adapted to suit a disability e.g., additional controls, 
        this will be noted on your full driving licence. There is a question on the application form for the driving test about 
        special needs. Any candidate with special needs should indicate this on the form so that necessary arrangements can be in 
        place when they attend for the test.</li>

         <li>Q. What happen if i fail the test?</li>
         <li>A. The tester will present you with a report detailing aspects of your driving that led you to fail the test. You 
         will also receive a Certificate indicating that you failed the test; you should retain this as you may require it when 
         renewing your provisional licence. Unfortunately, the tester is not permitted to discuss your test results with you. If 
         you wish to apply for a further test, application forms are available at test centres or you can apply online on this 
         website.</li>
         
         <li>Q. If i fail my driving test can i renew my provisional licence?</li>
         <li>A. Eligibility for a third or subsequent provisional licence is dependent on you having undergone a driving test 
         within the previous two years or providing medical evidence for not having undertaken it or having evidence of a 
         forthcoming test appointment. Your local Motor Tax Office will clarify issues relating to your eligibility for a 
         provisional licence.</li>
         
         <li>Q. I hold an American State licence. Can I exchange it for a UK licence?</li>
         <li>A. If you hold a full driving licence issued outside the European Economic Area it may be possible to exchange it for
          an equivalent GB licence. There is a booklet (the D100) which you can get from most post offices, this booklet explains 
          the exchange licence regulations. You can also contact the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency who will tell you if you 
          can or cannot exchange your driving licence. If you cannot exchange your licence you will need to take and pass a theory
           test before you can book a practical driving test.</li>
          
          <li>Q. My dad says it's easy to pass the driving test. Has it changed over the years since he took it?</li>
          <li>A. The test is more rigorous than it used to be. It lasts longer, the roads are busier, the marking is tougher and 
            there's more extensive testing of manoeuvres. It takes longer to prepare for today's test but it is still easy to pass
            for those who are fully prepared.</li>
            
          <li>Q. When you are waiting at the front of a queue at traffic lights do you have to wait in first gear or wait in 
          neutral?</li>
          <li>A. You can wait in first gear if you think the lights are about to change. Sometimes you can 'read' the lights by 
          watching the changes from the other traffic lights. If you can see them about to change you can get yourself ready by 
          selecting first gear.</li>
          
          <li>Q. Which manoeuvres will I have to do?</li>
          <li>A. You may be asked to do any of the following manoeuvres: reversing around a corner to the left or right; turning 
            the car in the road; reverse (parallel) parking; moving off at an angle from behind a parked vehicle; and reversing 
            into a parking bay. You may also be asked to perform an emergency stop.</li>

          <li>Q.	How are my mistakes marked?</li>
          <li>A.	The examiner will keep track of your drive on a form (Driving Test Report). The form lists a number of items 
          that relate to your control of the car, its equipment and your procedure on the road. There are three categories of 
          mistake that can be recorded. <br><br>
          1. <strong>Dangerous faults</strong>: these are marked if your actions actually cause danger.<br>
          2. <strong>Serious faults</strong>: these are faults that could be dangerous in a different set of circumstances or are 
          habitual errors that are potentially dangerous. <br>
		  3. <strong>Driving faults</strong>: these are less serious errors that detract from 'perfect drive'. A single dangerous 
          or serious fault will lead to test failure. You are currently permitted a maximum of 15 less serious 'Driving faults' 
          although it is unlikely you will make anywhere near that many.</li>
          
          <li>Q. Should you keep out of the centre painted area of road, called chevrons, if bordered by a broken line, when 
          turning right into a side road? </li>
          <li> A. So long as it is safe to drive over them you can drive into the area. That is what they are there for, to 
          protect a vehicle turning right, from other traffic. Also, often it is almost impossible to get positioned properly in 
          the centre, if you do keep out of them. </li>
        </ul>
